    <!-- NOTE FROM INSTRUCTOR:
	 to get module-use to work properly, we must use the type="module" attribute
	 in order to guarantee that the browser has both modules before everything
	 is rendered.  This is pretty standard practice in JavaScript nowadays,
	 even in plain vanilla JS.

	 The other significant difference from the previous implementation
	 is that the module's state is not visible to console-/top-level
	 functionality...  So, in this implementation, we may NOT access the
	 backpack object
