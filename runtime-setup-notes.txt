Installation into Debian-flavored Linux:
Using standard Debian tools:
Had to install npm, and a flavor of eslint came along with that for the ride,
via the Debian package management "infrastructure," aptitude.

Then, as the instructor specified, I ran the following from the
shell prompt, inside the top-level directory of this repository:
  npm install
This got npm to install all of the needed node/javascript "packages"
needed for the course.

This included a flavor of the live-server, a newer/different flavor
of the eslint tool, and some form of the prettier javascript code
formatter/indenter.

To get the live-server running, use:
  npx live-server --no-browser .
This will let you serve up basic stuff from within the entire project
tree; point your browser at:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
to get started.

Also, run the prettier tool by:
  npx prettier <JAVASCRIPT_FILE>

Also, run the locally-installed flavor of eslint by:
  npx eslint <JAVASCRIPT_FILE>

The "npx" command is a node-javascript program "runner/launcher"
used to run the "package/application" specified.

I decided to run these "by hand" from the command line instead
of trying to figure out how to run VSCode.  I wanted to stick
to using Emacs as my text editor (which could probably invoke
prettier and eslint for me just like VSCode does!) and did NOT
want to further bloat my setup with one more "special editor"
just to get through the course!

Learning enough about how to use npm-ecosystem as it is...
